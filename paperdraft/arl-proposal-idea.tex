We are interested in the diffusion of the camera and lidar data from the same robot and parametric estimation methods. (2) new point cloud processing method for multi-robot loop closure. Both sub-areas are computing-intensive tasks that are typically designated as 'lazy' processes. Our focus will be on the novel computing techniques offered by machine learning.
